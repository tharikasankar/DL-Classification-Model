# Developing a Neural Network Classification Model

## AIM
To develop a neural network classification model for the given dataset.

## THEORY
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to build a neural network model that can classify a given iris flower into one of these three species based on the provided features.

## Neural Network Model
Include the neural network model diagram.
